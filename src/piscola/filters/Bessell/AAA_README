  copy fudged U-filters from Technotes/Marriner/U_filters
  to Bessell90_Ux.xx.dat, where x.xx is the fraction that
  the U-filter is stretched blueward with red edge fixed.

  Here are the color transformation terms, k2(U-B)
  versus U-filter stretch:

U-stretch  k_2 
0.5       -0.544
0.6       -0.436
0.7       -0.331
0.8       -0.230
0.9       -0.132
