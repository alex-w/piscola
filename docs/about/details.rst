About the Code
========================

This code was built as part of my PhD project at the University of Southmapton (UK) under the supervision of Mark Sullivan (supervisor) and Mat Smith. The main goal of the code is to fit type Ia supernovae and use them to do cosmology. The idea of this documentation is to make the code as transparent as possible (how it works under the hood) so the user doesn't use it as a black box.
