Conda environment
=================

It is recommended to create a conda environment with the necessary packages:

.. code::

        conda config --add channels conda-forge

	conda create -n <env> matplotlib pandas lmfit peakutils george extinction multiprocess

However, ``sfdmap`` would need to be installed manually with ``pip``.
